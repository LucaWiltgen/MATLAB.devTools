## Pre-requisites

Please follow the [configuration instructions](PREREQUISITES.md) carefully. You may skip this if your system is already set up and you have `git` configured.

## How do I use `MATLAB.devTools`?

Type in `MATLAB` within the `devTools` folder:
```
>> contribute
```

The original repository will be downloaded (cloned) the first time to a folder named `fork-gitRepoName`. **Only files in the `fork-gitRepoName` folder** will be considered for contribution (any changes made to a downloaded official `git` repository will be ignored).
