# The COBRA Toolbox - Developer Tools

## How can I contribute?

Let me see this [**live**](https://)!

*video to be recorded*

In order to start contributing, follow the [installation instructions](https://) of The COBRA Toolbox. Making a contribution to The COBRA Toolbox is a very straightforward process.

You must first *fork* the repository of The COBRA Toolbox. Browse to the [original repository](https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox) and click on the button `Fork`.

![Fork the repo](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/fork_button.jpg)

Think of a name for your contribution, i.e. `name-of-my-contribution`. Type (after you have installed The COBRA Toolbox) in `MATLAB`:
```
contribute
```

You will then be presented by a menu that you can select your option from:
```
[1] Initialize a contribution.
[2] Continue a contribution.
[3] Submit/publish a contribution.
[4] Delete a contribution.
```

**Please note that only files that are in the folder `fork-cobratoolbox` will be considered for contribution. Any changes made to the downloaded and installed official COBRA Toolbox will be ignored by the system**.

Once you submit your contribution (menu item 4), you will be presented with a link that leads you directly to the pull request. Fill-out the form that is presented to you by following this link, and you can submit the PR.

## I need more guidance

If you don't want to get your hands dirty right away, start-off by reading the [Contributing Guide](https://).
